 # Rayshader Projects Repo 
This repository serves to showcase all my visualizations and maps created using the rayshader package in R or python. I was inspired by [Milos Popovic](https://github.com/milos-agathon) who has extensively applied the package in geospatial analysis. 
 ### Each project folder typically includes: 
* R scripts or notebooks showcasing the code used to generate the visualization or map.
* Input data sources (if applicable).
* Output images or interactive visualizations.
